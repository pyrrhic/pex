Bellow is a list of links leading to an image, read this list of images and find 3 most prevalent colors in the RGB scheme in hexadecimal format (#000000 - #FFFFFF) in each image, and write the result into a CSV file in a form of url,color,color,color.

Please focus on speed and resources. The solution should be able to handle input files with more than a billion URLs, using limited resources (e.g. 1 CPU, 512MB RAM).

Answer should be posted in a git repo.
